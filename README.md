# Trie-based Autocomplete Program

This C++ program implements an efficient autocomplete system using a Trie data structure. It allows users to input a prefix, and the program suggests words stored in the Trie that begin with that prefix. This is akin to the autocomplete functionality seen in search engines or text editors, enhancing user experience by predicting and suggesting possible word completions.

## Features

- **Efficient Word Insertion**: Quickly insert words into the Trie for later retrieval.
- **Autocomplete Suggestions**: Given a prefix, the program suggests complete words that start with that prefix.
- **Scalable**: Efficiently handles a large dictionary of words with minimal performance impact.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C++ compiler (GCC or Clang recommended)
- GNU Make (for building the project using the provided Makefile)

### Building the Program

1. **Clone the Repository**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/fatinm1/Spell-Checker.git

    ```

2. **Compile the Program**

    Use the provided Makefile for easy compilation:

    ```sh
    make driver
    ```

### Running the Program

After compiling, you can run the program using:

```sh
./driver
